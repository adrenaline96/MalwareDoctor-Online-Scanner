# MalwareDoctor-Online-Scanner
A simple ASP.NET application to scan files for malware. Based on VirusTotal.NET (https://github.com/Genbox/VirusTotal.Net)

Things to take into consideration:

1. The design looks like 1990s, it's a basic white page, I didn't work on design

2. In order to get VirusTotal results going you need your own API key.

3. Prerequisites in order to get the code working: the VirusTotal.NET NuGet package (which will install the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package as well)
