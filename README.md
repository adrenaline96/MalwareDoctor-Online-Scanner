# MalwareDoctor-Online-Scanner
A simple ASP.NET application to scan files for malware. Based on VirusTotal.NET (https://github.com/Genbox/VirusTotal.Net) and VXVault (http://vxvault.net/ViriList.php).

Things to take into consideration:

1. The design is very simplistic.

2. In order to get VirusTotal results going you need your own API key. Place the key code inside the VT_API.key file in the Misc folder.

3. Prerequisites in order to get the code working: the VirusTotal.NET NuGet package (which will install the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package as well), the "Uploads" folder that will contain the files uploaded through your app, and the "cfg" folder with the API key file.

4. You need to add the following lines into Web.config > configuration
```
<appSettings>
    <add key="UploadPath" value="~/Uploads/"/>
    <add key="VTKey" value="~/cfg/VT_API.key"/>
  </appSettings>
  ```

5. I added the logo in the "Content" folder.
