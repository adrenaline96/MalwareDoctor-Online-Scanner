# MalwareDoctor-Online-Scanner
A simple ASP.NET application to scan files for malware. Based on VirusTotal.NET (https://github.com/Genbox/VirusTotal.Net), Malc0de (http://malc0de.com/database/) and VXVault (http://vxvault.net/ViriList.php).

Things to take into consideration:

1. The design looks like 1990s, it's a basic white page, I didn't work on design. The app is barebones, consider it as a starting point for something more serious, there are a lot of things to be changed but it's a starting point.

2. In order to get VirusTotal results going you need your own API key. Place the key code inside the VT_API.key file in the Misc folder.

3. Prerequisites in order to get the code working: the VirusTotal.NET NuGet package (which will install the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package as well), the "Uploads" folder that will contain the files uploaded through your app, and the "Misc" folder with the API key file.
